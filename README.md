Things to consider while working on a project or learning a new topic:
1. Time is important, use it wisely ⏳
2. Concentrate on a single topic and then work with problem variations 
3. Consistency is the key 🔑
4. Learn what you like, clear the basics and you are good to go for most of the platforms.
